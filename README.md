# Seraphim-Code
This was code written for an old website project back around 2018 for college when we were learning HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. This project was used for a place to learn and is since deprecated, non-functional, and no longer being developed.

# Goal
to develop a simple site that utilizes API and displays information to the user focused around the API.
